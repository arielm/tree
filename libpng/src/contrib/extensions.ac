# CONTRIBUTED EXTENSIONS
#
# The following extensions are part of a standard libpng distribution.  They are
# not supported parts of libpng and they are not necessarily released under the
# same license as libpng.  Please consult the relevant directory for copyright
# and support information before uncommenting any of the lines below.
#
# After you change this file you MUST re-run "autoreconf" to regenerate the
# configure script, otherwise the change may have no effect.
#
# Include the ARM NEON extension:
#sinclude([contrib/neon/neon.ac])
#
# If any of the extensions require automake support (this is likely) automake
# must include the file contrib/extensions.am
#libpng_automake_extensions="yes"
